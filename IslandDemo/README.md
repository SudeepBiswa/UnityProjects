# Week 1 Assesment


This a demo with a SINGLEPLAYER gameplay focus where the goal is to collect the 5 food items that spawn within the map.
   
To access this you can either play test it by clicking "Test Active Scene"
   
or you can play it on the spatial website itself with the following link.

The mechanics are simple.
Just use WASD to walk around and the space bar to jump. 
And to collect the food items, just walk into them.

There were a couple challenges faced during this assessment. 
   1. The main challenge was learning spatial and learning ways around its limitations.
        A bulk of my time was spent looking through documentation which evidently helped me overcome my lack of spatial knowledge.

   2. Another is figuring out how to control and adjust the camera to my liking. I read through and tried many things and eventaully got some resuilts. Unfortunately they were not results I liked very much.

These challenges are explained in more detail within the progress video.
